Evidence from India”.                                                                1","“They may protest the administrative machinery and thereby break the law, but they are seen as local              heroes who are trying to help poor people by diﬀerent means” - (NY Times, 2014)                 “Earlier politicians used criminals. Now the criminals themselves have entered politics” - (Asso-              ciated Press, 2014)                 1     Introduction                    Despite a history of widely contested and transparent elections, and the presence of a vibrant              and open media, India elects an ever-increasing number of politicians facing criminal charges. The              share of Members of Parliament, the national legislature, who face pending criminal charges has              risen from 24 percent in 2004 to 34 percent in 2014 (NY Times 2014).        1  While the election of              criminally accused candidates to public oﬃce is concerning in any context, this is especially true              for India. Large quantities of funds are distributed by the government through a wide variety of              interventions and programs, which have been plagued by costly scandals with estimated losses in                                                                                    2             the hundreds of billions of dollars (Sukhtankar and Vaishnav 2015). This problem is exacerbated             by a severely understaﬀed judiciary and police force, resulting in an extremely slow judicial system. 3              Taken together, these realities create a context in which an inﬂux of criminally accused politicians              could be especially costly for an economy.                  In this paper, we examine the aggregate economic costs of electing criminally accused politicians              to State Legislative Assemblies (Vidhan Sabhas) in India for elections held during the 2004 to 2008              period. It is generally accepted, both in the literature and in public debate, that the election of              criminally accused candidate is likely to have substantial economic costs for a constituency. Despite              this widespread belief of an adverse eﬀect, no formal estimates exist. We take advantage of a Supreme              Court of India order in 2003 which required all candidates seeking election to the Parliament of India                 1                 http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/23/in-the-newly-elected-indian-parliament-worrying-trends/             ?_r=0.                2 Looking at a statutory wage increase for participants in India’s employment guarantee scheme (NREGS), Niehaus             and Sukhtankar (2013) estimate marginal leakage of almost 100%. Similarly, Baskaran et al. (2015), Nagavarapu and             Sekhri (2013), and Min and Golden (2014) ﬁnd that the allocation of electricity is distorted by political incentives.                3 For instance, Suhkatankar and Vaishnav (2015) note that nearly 60 percent of police positions are unﬁlled in             Uttar Pradesh. Nationwide, 20 to 30 percent of district, subordinate and High court seats are unﬁlled and close to a             quarter of all cases have been pending for 5 years or more and there is a backlog of over 31 million cases.                                                                   2","or to State Legislative Assemblies to disclose information on their criminal background in a sworn              aﬃdavit submitted to the Election Commission of India (ECI). The data from these aﬃdavits not              only allow us to identify criminally charged candidates, but also allow to diﬀerentiate candidates by              the types and number of charges.                  We measure constituency-level economic activity using satellite data on the intensity of night-time              lights, since no GDP data are available for the state assembly constituencies. Night-time lights data              have been used as a robust proxy for economic activity and measures of micro-development (Bleakley              and Lin 2012, Henderson et al. 2012, Hodler and Rashky 2014, Michalopoulos and Papaioannou              2013, 2014, Pinkovskiy 2013, Storeygard 2014) at both the national and sub-national levels and oﬀer                                  4             several advantages. First, unlike large household and economic surveys in India, night-time lights             data are available at a highly disaggregated geographical level and can be aggregated to compile              constituency-level measures. Second, these data are available annually, thus allowing for a more              credible time series analysis. Third, night-time lights data are collected automatically by satellites              and are therefore less prone to biases that may be present in administrative data.                  An important challenge in this setting is to account for the unobserved heterogeneity between              constituencies that elect criminally accused candidates and those that do not. For instance, crimi-              nally accused candidates may be more likely to run (and win) from certain constituencies than others.              Therefore, constituencies that elect criminally accused candidates may not be comparable to those              that elect non-accused candidates. Using a regression discontinuity design that credibly identiﬁes              the eﬀect of electing criminally accused politicians by comparing constituencies which elect crimi-              nally accused with those which elect non-accused politicians in close elections, we ﬁnd that electing              a criminally accused politician has a large negative eﬀect on economic activity in their constituency.              On average, constituencies in which a criminally accused candidate barely won experienced roughly              22-percentage point lower yearly growth in the intensity of night-time lights than those constituen-              cies which barely elected a non-accused candidate. Moreover, these eﬀects are larger for politicians              accused of serious or ﬁnancial criminal charges. Using existing estimates from the literature on the              elasticity of GDP growth to night-time lights growth, this is roughly equivalent to roughly 2.3-6.5                 4                 Pinkovskiy and Sala-i-Martin (2016) provides a literature review of the nighttime lights measure and propose a             data-driven method to assess the relative quality of GDP per capita and survey means by comparing them to the             evolution of satellite-recorded nighttime lights. Michalopoulos and Papaioannou (2013) cross-validate the satellite             light density and regional development by examining the relationship between luminosity and economic performance             using micro-level data from the Demographic and Health Surveys.                                                                3","percentage point lower GDP growth per year. We further ﬁnd that the negative impact varies by              state characteristics. In particular, the costs are more pronounced in states with high corruption              levels, lower levels of development and plausibly weaker institutions (so-called ‘BIMAROU’ states).                  We ﬁnd very similar eﬀects using a proxy for public good provision: the roads built annually under              the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) program. The length (in kms) of roads built              annually under the PMGSY is signiﬁcantly lower in constituencies in which an accused politician              barely won compared to constituencies in which a non-accused barely won (we discuss this in Section              6). Overall, these results highlight the high aggregate economic costs of electing lower quality              politicians (i.e. criminally accused) and point to likely signiﬁcant individual costs in foregone access              to public services.                  Our paper contributes to several related literatures. Most narrowly, our ﬁndings contribute to              the emerging literature on criminally accused politicians in India. Existing studies typically focus              on the selection of these candidates; some examine the response of voters to information on criminal              status or criminal charges and the potential mitigating eﬀect of caste politics (Banerjee et al. 2014,              Charchard 2014). Others examine the selection of these candidates by political parties (Aidt et              al. 2012, Tiwari 2014, Vaishnav 2011a, 2011b, 2011c). However, this growing body of literature on              preferences over politician type and how to ﬁght the selection of corrupt politician implicitly assumes              that such politicians are less desirable for their constituencies, although the actual eﬀect is unknown.              Our study provides the ﬁrst evidence of the aggregate economic cost of electing criminally accused                         5             politicians. Since criminally accused politicians are not limited to India, this indicator may also be             more broadly applicable (for e.g. Brazil and Pakistan). 6,7                  Additionally, we contribute to the discussion regarding whether criminal accusations are ‘too              noisy’ a signal to be useful for research or policy. In part, this concern arises since political rivals              may have the incentive and means to fabricate charges against opponents. Similarly, there are              examples of political activists being charged while participating in democratic protests (Jaﬀrelot              and Verniers 2014). We ﬁnd that accusations can provide useful information regarding politicians              as the economic costs vary with the type and the number of criminal charges.                 5                 Chemin (2012) shows that the election of accused politicians has distributional impacts by reducing the per capita             expenditure of SC, ST, and OBC members. However, he does not investigate the overall eﬀects.                6                 Almost 200 legislators, or a third of Brazil’s Congress, are facing charges in trials overseen by the Supreme Federal             Tribunal (see: http://www.law360.com/articles/457373/brazil-has-had-it-with-corporate-bribery).                7                 Criminality and politics in Pakistan (see: http://www.dawn.com/news/1200870).                                                               4","We also make a modest contribution to the literature on the quality of politicians which typ-              ically uses proxies such as education (Alcantara 2008, Besley et al. 2005, De Paola and Scoppa              2010, Martinez-Bravo 2014) and, more recently, personality (Callen et al. 2015). As our results              demonstrate, whether or not a politician is criminally accused can have an important eﬀect on the              constituency level economic outcomes. Consequently, we believe that this may represent a pre-              election indicator of candidate quality.                  Finally, although our study focuses on India, it contributes to the broader understanding of              the costs of electing lower quality politicians in clientelistic democracies. We ﬁnd that the costs              of electing criminally accused politicians are concentrated in states that are less developed and              have higher levels of corruption. These ﬁndings are consistent with papers that suggest that low              quality politicians (such as criminals) may provide targeted beneﬁts to certain voters (Chandra 2004,              Vaishnav 2011a, Banerjee and Pande 2007) based on certain salient factors, such as caste, ethnicity              or class. Robinson and Verdier (2013) and van de Walle (2005) further suggest that less developed              countries are associated with this type of clientelist or patronage politics. Bardhan and Mookherjee              (2012) note that patronage democracies can lead to excessively short-term payoﬀs and a lack of long              run investmetns, included the provision of public goods. In such democracies, criminally accused              politicians may be especially detrimental for economic development and public goods delivery.                  The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide the background              on the elected representatives in India and discuss the corruption and criminality in Indian politics.              Section 3 discusses the empirical strategy, followed by the data description and the validity of the              regression discontinuity design in Section 4. We present the impact of electing criminally accused              politicians on night-lights in Section 5. Section 6 estimates the impact of electing criminally accused              on a measure public good–roads construction, and Section 7 calculates the eﬀect on GDP. We present              variety of robustness checks in Section 8, and conclude the paper in Section 9.                                                                                  5","2     Background                2.1    Elected Representatives in India                   India is a federal republic with a parliamentary system of government. The Parliament of India,              the national level legislature, consists of two Houses–an Upper House (also called the Rajya Sabha              or the Council of States) and a Lower House (also called the Lok Sabha or the House of the Peo-              ple). Those elected or nominated to either House of the Parliament are referred to as Members of              Parliament (or MPs). State assemblies in India follow a similar structure where the Upper House is              called the Legislative Council (or Vidhan Parishad) and the Lower House is called the Legislative              Assembly (or Vidhan Sabha). Those elected to the state Legislative Assembly are referred to as              Members of the Legislative Assembly (or MLAs). Similar to the national level, the election system              at the state level is a “ﬁrst-past-the-post” system and constituencies are divided into single member              constituencies. The term of each MLA is 5 years, although it is possible to have elections before the              5-year term mostly due to shifting of political alignments. The focus in this paper is on the members              elected to the state legislative assemblies.                  The Indian Constitution grants elected representatives certain responsibilities. In particular,              MLAs hold legislative, ﬁnancial, and executive power. In addition to these constitutional pow-              ers, they also have control over the state bureaucracy, especially in promotions and job assign-              ment/transfers (Asher and Novosad 2015, Iyer and Mani 2012, Krishnan and Somanathan 2013,                                                          8             Nath 2014, Sukhtankar and Vaishnav 2015) , which allows them to play a key role in the allocation             of funds for various development projects, distribution of licenses, and facilitate access to governmen-              tal schemes through the bureaucratic machinery. Collaboration with or control of the bureaucracy              also allows politicians to act as mediators between the private sector and the government, and to              lobby political allies and business contacts to bring projects to their constituencies (Bussell 2012,              Chopra 1996, Jensenius 2013). Finally, MLAs also have access to discretionary development funds              through the Member of Legislative Assembly Constituency Development Scheme which they can              spend on development projects within their constituencies. Therefore, elected representatives can                 8 The  nexus  between  politicians  and  bureaucrats,  and  in  particular,  the  possibility  of  bribes             involving  job  assignments/transfer  of  bureaucrats  was  recently  alleged  in  a  press  conference             on   May   22,   2015  by   the  Chief  Minister  of  Delhi  (http://www.ndtv.com/video/player/news/             kejriwal-says-centre-has-betrayed-people-of-delhi-by-siding-with-lieutenant-governor/368367).                                                                  6","both directly and indirectly aﬀect economic activity in their constituencies.                 2.2    Corruption and Criminality in Indian Politics                   Elected oﬃcials are widely reputed to be involved in corruption, mostly the graft and embez-              zlement of public funds (BBC News India 2012, India Today 2012). A recent paper by Sukhtankar              and Vaishnav (2015) compiled an inventory of the biggest public corruption scandals uncovered after                                                                                 9             2003, and found amounts totaling hundreds of billions of dollars. Fisman et al. (2014) utilize the             asset disclosures of candidates for Indian state legislators and compare the asset growth of election              winners versus runners-up to calculate the ﬁnancial returns from holding public oﬃce relative to the              private sector opportunities available to political candidates. They ﬁnd that the estimated annual              growth rate of the winners’ assets is 3-5 percent higher than those of the runners-up. Similarly,              Bhavnani (2012) compares the change in winners’ and losers’ self-declared family assets in India’s              two most recent state and national elections, and ﬁnds that the average election winner increased              their assets by 4-6 percent a year. 10                  The issue of criminally accused candidates contesting elections in India is not new and has              been debated at the highest level by the Election Commission of India, and the Indian Parliament.              Even the Supreme Court of India showed serious concern about the increasing “criminalization”              of politics, leading to its landmark judgment which made the criminal backgrounds of politicians              public. In 2003, the Supreme Court of India required candidates seeking election to the Parliament              or to a Legislative Assembly to ﬁle sworn aﬃdavits detailing information on their professional and              educational qualiﬁcations, their assets and liabilities and those of their immediate family, and their              criminal convictions and charges. In particular, the aﬃdavits require candidates to report prior              convictions and any pending accusations for which the oﬀence is punishable with imprisonment for              two years or more, and in which a charge is framed or cognizance is taken by the Court of Law (that              is, any criminal indictment). These charges are limited to those framed prior to the six-month period                9 Table 1 of Sukhtankar and Vaishnav (2015) estimates a mean scam “value” of Rs. 36,000 crore (about 5.6 billion             USD), and a median of Rs. 12,000 crore (about 1.9 billion USD).               10                 According to Banerjee et al. (2011(, in the case of Uttar Pradesh state legislators, the 287 elected MLAs in 2007             who ran for elections again in 2012 witnessed an increase in their average asset value from $220,613 to $658,804 over             their 5 year term in oﬃce. At that time, the average annual salary of MLAs in Uttar Pradesh was approximately             $12,000. The political aﬃliation was especially important as MLAs who belonged to the political party heading the             state government (or the ruling party) saw their asset value increase by an average of $500,000. For opposition party             members, this increase amounted to less than $300,000.                                                                 7","preceding an election. Since candidates face penalties for lying on the sworn aﬃdavits and since rival              candidates (and the media) have incentives to verify information contained in these aﬃdavits, any              deliberate misreporting should be minimized.  11                  The Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), an election watchdog, along with the National              Election Watch have conducted so-called Election Watches for all state and federal elections since              2003 in India. 12  Surprisingly, the percentage of MPs facing criminal charges has increased between              the 2009 and 2014 elections for the national Parliament. The ﬁndings are similar for the state              assembly elections. According to the ADR report, over 30 percent of the MLAs currently face              criminal cases. 13                 3     Regression Discontinuity Design                    A key contribution of this paper is the identiﬁcation of causal eﬀect of electing criminally accused              politicians to state assemblies in India on constituency level economic activity. The main challenge in              doing this is that the victory of criminally accused politicians is not necessarily random; for example,              criminally accused candidates may be more likely to run and win from certain constituencies than              others in ways that are unobservable to us. As a result, average diﬀerences in economic activity              between constituencies that elected an accused MLA and those that elected a non-accused MLA will              result in a biased estimate of the eﬀect of electing criminally accused candidates.                  A regression discontinuity (RD) design (Lee 2008, Imbens and Lemieux 2008) allows us to ex-              ploit a discontinuity in the treatment assignment to identify the causal eﬀect of a treatment vari-              able. 14  In our setting, the assignment of treatment, whether a candidate is criminally accused or                11                 These are sworn aﬃdavits and there is a penalty for ﬁling incorrect aﬃdavit (e.g. disqualiﬁcation, imprisonment             for a term which may extend to six months, or a ﬁne, or both). The aﬃdavits can be accessed from the ECI’s web-             site (http://eci.nic.in/eci/eci.html) and its website on candidate aﬃdavit (http://eci.nic.in/eci_main1/             LinktoAffidavits.aspx).               12                 An Election Watch comprises of background reports based on Criminal, Financial, Educational and Income Tax             details of Candidates and Winners (MPs, MLAs and Ministers) who have contested Elections to State Assemblies,             the Parliament and a few local bodies.               13 For example, in one of most populous and politically important state, Uttar Pradesh, 575 of the candidates for             the 403 assembly seats had criminal backgrounds or faced criminal charges during the 2007 state legislative assembly             elections. Out of these, 140 won the assembly seats. Unsurprisingly, following this success, an even greater number             of criminally accused candidates (759) ran in the subsequent elections in 2012. Of these, 189 won seats in the state             assembly (ADR, 2012a).               14 The seminal paper by Lee (2008) exploits a regression discontinuity design using electoral data. Studies using a             similar design in the context of India and elsewhere include Asher and Novosad (2014), Bhalotra et al. (2013), Bhalotra             and Clots-Figueras (2014), Broockman (2014), Clots-Figueras (2011, 2012), Fisman et al. (2014), and Uppal (2009).                                                                 8","not (ACCUSED), is determined solely on the basis of a cutoﬀ value, c=0, of the forcing variable,              the victory margin (MARGIN). The treatment assignment follows a known deterministic rule,              ACCUSED = 1 (MARGIN ≥ 0), where 1(.) is the indicator function. The constituencies which              fall below the cutoﬀ (MARGIN < 0), the control group (ACCUSED = 0), elect a non-accused              candidate who won against an accused runner-up, and the victory margin in these elections is the              diﬀerence between the vote shares of the accused runner-up and the non-accused winner. Constituen-              cies that fall above the cutoﬀ (MARGIN ≥ 0), the treatment group (ACCUSED = 1), elect a              criminally accused candidate who won against a non-accused runner-up, and the victory margin in              these elections is the diﬀerence in vote shares of the accused winner and the non-accused runner-up.              Therefore, at the victory margin of zero, the accusation status of a politician changes discontin-              uously from non-accused to criminally accused. Thus, as the victory margin becomes arbitrarily              small (i.e. as we move closer to the cutoﬀ), the outcome of an election is as good as random. As a              result, constituencies that barely elected a non-accused politician in a close election serve as a valid              counterfactual for constituencies that barely elect a criminally accused politician.                  We consider the following speciﬁcation for estimating the RD treatment eﬀect of electing a              criminally accused candidate to state legislative assemblies relative to a non-accused candidate:                                                                                                                   (1)                       GROWTH i,s,t+1 = α s + β t+1 + γACCUSED i,s,t + f(MARGIN i,s,t ) + µ i,s,t+1                ∀ MARGIN i,s,t ∈ (c − h, c + h)                  where GROWTH i,s,t+1 is the yearly growth rate in night-time lights, our primary outcome of              interest. This is measured as the diﬀerence in the natural log of night-time lights intensity for the              constituency between the current and the previous period, for e.g. [Log(Y i,s,t+1 )-Log(Y i,s,t )], also              widely accepted in the literature as a proxy for economic activity. We do not include the night light              measure for the year of election as it could be driven by the previous candidate in our speciﬁcation.              α s is the state ﬁxed eﬀects and control for any time-invariant state characteristics.                  We follow Henderson et al. (2012) and Chen and Nordhaus (2011) by including year ﬁxed              eﬀects β t+1 in our estimating equation to control for contemporaneous shocks aﬀecting all units in a              year, including any factors that may aﬀect the overall brightness detected by a sensor in any given              year. In addition, the year ﬁxed eﬀects also controls for any macroeconomic shocks or national                                                                 9","policies that aﬀected all states uniformly. In robustness tests, we also use year–state interaction to              control for any state-level economic trends or policies. The variable ACCUSED i,s,t is the treatment,              MARGIN i,s,t is the forcing variable, and h is the neighborhood around the cutoﬀ c=0, also referred              to as the bandwidth. The control function f(MARGIN i,s,t ) is some continuous function, usually a              n-order polynomial in the forcing variable on each side of c. Finally µ i,s,t+1 is the error term. The              coeﬃcient of primary interest γ estimates the causal impact of electing criminally accused politicians              to state assemblies in India on economic activity as proxied by the growth of night-time lights. The              identiﬁcation of this causal eﬀect relies on fairly weak conditions on the conditional distribution of              the error term µ, which is assumed to be a continuous function of the forcing variable (MARGIN).                  We estimate a local linear regression (Hahn, Todd, and Van der Klaauw 2001, Porter 2003,              Imbens and Lemieux 2008) as it allows for a suitable bandwidth with a linear control function.      15              Our preferred bandwidth speciﬁcation follows the optimal bandwidth algorithm proposed by Imbens              and Kalyanaraman (2012) [referred to as IK (h)]. As a robustness check, we also estimate the local              linear regression using the optimal bandwidth proposed by Calonico, Cattaneo and Titiunik (2014),              half the optimal bandwidth (h/2), and twice the optimal bandwidth (2h). Since growth in night-time              lights is likely to be correlated over time within a constituency, the standard errors are clustered at              the constituency level.                 4     Data Description and Validity of the RD Design                 4.1    Night-time Lights as a Measure of Economic Activity                   To study the costs associated with electing criminally accused candidates, we need a measure              of economic activity at the state assembly constituency level, our unit of analysis. To the best of              our knowledge, no such data exist in India.  16  Large surveys, such as the National Sample Survey,              the India Human Development Survey, and the Economic Census of Firms are only available at the               15                 Diﬀerent variations of equation (1) with diﬀerent bandwidths and control function have been used in the literature.             For example. Lee et al. (2004) use parametric regression-based higher order polynomials in the control function             (second-order, third-order, and fourth-order polynomials), thus allowing all the observations to be used in the RD             estimation. However, this method puts equal weight on observations far from the cutoﬀ, which can be misleading             (Gelman and Imbens 2014).               16                 Although we could in principle use the Census of India to look at various measures of public goods, it is only             available for the years 2001 and 2011, and therefore will not allow us to look at the annual change in outcome measures             at the state assembly constituency level.                                                                 10","district level. These cannot be used for three reasons. First, the number of constituencies varies              across districts and there is no logical way to weight constituencies within districts. 17  Second, even              if a constituency level measure of economic activity could be derived, the above mentioned surveys              are not available annually. Third, these surveys only capture measures of income and consumption              at the district level.                  We use data on the intensity of night-time lights as a proxy for economic activity. Recent              contributions of Henderson et al. (2012), Hodler and Rashky (2014), Michalopoulos and Papaioannou              (2013, 2014), and Storeygard (2014) and previous work of Elvidge et al. (1997) ﬁnds the use of night-              time lights data as a useful proxy for development for regional analysis in countries with poor quality              income data. 18,19  Results from Doll et al. (2006) and Pinkovskiy (2013) shows that light density at              night is a robust proxy of economic activity. More recently, Dhillon et al. (2016) use the National              Election Survey from 2004, which surveys voters at the parliamentary constituency level, to examine              the correlation of standard economic indicators with night-lights in India. They ﬁnd the correlation              of night-lights with wealth to be about 0.6, while that with income and education lies between 0.4              and 0.45. 20  Overall, these studies ﬁnd a strong within country relationship between GDP levels and              night-time lights intensity and growth rates (see Pinkovskiy and Sala-i-Martin 2016). Night-time              lights data oﬀer several advantages, most importantly that the pixels can easily be aggregated to the              constituency level and that the availability of annual frequency allows for more detailed temporal              analysis. Moreover, whether through increased electriﬁcation or higher incomes levels, it should              arguably be related to local economic activity.               17                 Based on the Delimitation Order of 1976, the constituency boundaries remained ﬁxed till 2008. As a result, there             were 4,120 state assembly constituencies. According to the Delimitation Order of 2008, the number of Assembly             constituencies are 4,033. Between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, the number of districts increased from 593 to 640.               18 Henderson et al. (2012) shows that night-time lights can also identify short run ﬂuctuations, including the Asian             Financial Crisis in Indonesia between 1997 and 1998 and the Rwandan Genocide between 1993 and 1994. Thus             satellite night-time lights data are a useful proxy for economic activity at temporal and geographic scales for which             traditional data sets are of poor quality or are unavailable (Henderson et al. 2012). Additionally, prior research shows             that the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program’s Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) can reliably detect             electriﬁed villages in developing countries and that the night lights output is a useful proxy for electricity provision             (Doll et al. 2006, Min et al. 2013, Baskaran et al. 2015). Recent papers have used night-time lights data to study             growth of cities in sub-Saharan Africa (Storeygard 2014), production activity in blockaded Palestinian towns of the             West Bank (Abrahams 2015, van der Weide et. al 2015), and urban form in China (Baum-Snow and Turner 2012)             and India (Harari 2015).               19                 Michalopoulos and Papaioannou (2014) show that light density is correlated strongly with proxies of public goods             including as access to electriﬁcation, the presence of a sewage system, access to piped water, and education and             development. Min (2008) ﬁnds a strong association between access to electricity, public-goods provision and night             light intensity for low income countries.               20                 Similar relationship holds at the district level in India (see Chaturvedi et al. 2011 and Bhandari and Roychowdhury             2011).                                                                11","The satellite data are collected by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA)              Defense Meteorological Satellite Program’s Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) via a set of              military weather satellites that have been orbiting the earth since 1970. 21  The result is a series of              images covering the globe for each year from 1992 onwards (Elvidge et al. 1997, 2001). Images are                                                                                    2             scaled onto a geo-referenced 30 arc-second grid (approximately 1 km ). The key dependent variable             is computed as the sum of all light values from all of the pixels within the boundaries of each state              assembly constituencies as deﬁned by the Election Commission of India.   22  Thus, we aggregate night-              time lights output to the state level assembly constituency to estimate economic costs of electing              criminally accused politicians.                  In the night-time lights data, each pixel is encoded with a measure of its annual average brightness              on a 6-bit scale from 0 to 63. Thus, it is top-coded at 63 and censored at 0 (i.e. the brightest              areas are not well measured and areas require some minimum level of light to be captured). Top-              coding is a concern since we are unable to observe increases in lighting above 63. However, this              should not be systematically related to close elections of criminally accused candidates. That said,              we subsequently replicate our analysis with and without the top coded constituencies to verify the              robustness. Another potential issue is blooming, which occurs when light from a brightly lit area spills              over into neighboring areas. While this is a concern around large cities, our sample is predominately              rural. However, for rural areas a related concern is whether night-time lights capture rural activity.              As we discussed above, night-time lights also allows dimmer lights to be captured in rural, electriﬁed              areas.                  Lastly, the levels of light output are relative brightness values. Since there is no onboard radiance              calibration on the satellite sensors, there is no way to convert the relative brightness values to an              actual level of illumination. This complicates time series analysis because changes in observed              brightness in diﬀerent annual composites may be due to real changes in light output on the ground              or due to technical factors related to gain levels or sensor properties. We follow Henderson et              al. (2012) and Chen and Nordhaus (2011), and account for this limitation by including year ﬁxed               21 The satellites record high resolution images of the entire earth each night typically between 8:30 and 10:00 pm local             time. The images, captured at an altitude of 830 km above the earth, record concentrations of outdoor lights, ﬁres,             and gas ﬂares at a ﬁne resolution of 0.56 km and a smoothed resolution of 2.7 km. These images are used to produce             annual composites during a calendar year, dropping images where lights are shrouded by cloud cover or overpowered             by the aurora or solar glare, and removing ephemeral lights like ﬁres, other temporary lighting phenomenon and noise.               22 We use GIS data on administrative boundaries of states and assembly constituencies to enable the aggregation             within each state assembly constituencies.                                                                12","eﬀects in our estimating equation to control for contemporaneous shocks aﬀecting all units in a year,              including any factors that may aﬀect the overall brightness detected by a sensor in any given year.              Finally, we utilize the data available on stable night lights that drop light values from pixels with              unstable light signatures over time.                  Our key dependent variable is the yearly growth in night-time lights. This is the diﬀerence in the              natural log of night-time lights intensity for the constituency between the periods (t + 1) and (t).              As discussed earlier, this has been widely accepted in the literature as a proxy for economic activity.              Another advantage of specifying the dependent variable in this form is that it allows us to roughly              calculate the impact on GDP using estimates from the literature on the elasticity of GDP growth              to night-time lights growth. We also present results using two alternate dependent variables: the              natural log of night-time lights, and the growth of night-time lights averaged over the entire election              term. These additional dependent variables are likely to be less sensitive when comparing growth              of night-time lights over time. We report the descriptive statistics of the key dependent variables in              Table 1-A. The dependent variables are observed for each year of the election term, thus we observe              about 4 observations for each included state level constituency.                  Finally, we also use another outcome variable that is a proxy for public good provision at the              constituency level: the length of roads built under the PMGSY program (in kms). PMGSY is a              fully centrally sponsored rural roads construction program launched in 2000 that aims to provide all              weather road connectivity in rural areas, and forms an integral part of the Government of India’s              poverty reduction strategy. This program has been described as “unprecedented in its scale and              scope”(Aggarwal 2015), connecting over 116,000 habitations with roads and another 23,000 currently              under construction as of January 2016. Under PMGSY, about 360,000 kms of rural roads are being              constructed with a projected investment of approximately US $14 billion for construction and US              $9 billion for “upgradation” of existing tracks. The administrative records of length of roads built              under PMGSY are publicly available in the Online Management and Monitoring System (OMMS).              We match roads data to the state assembly constituency level data to estimate the impact of electing              criminally accused politicians on this measure of public good in Section 6. 23                23                 The 2001 Census is the source for habitation-level data, which are collected by the PMGSY in order to determine             the prioritization of roads.The PMGSY data are available at the census block level. Although there is no one-to-             one matching between census blocks and state assembly constituencies (for e.g., a block can span more than one             constituency), we match a block to a speciﬁc constituency if at least 50 percent of the villages in the block fell in that             constituency.                                                                13","4.2    Election Results and Aﬃdavit Data                   We use the Election Commission of India (ECI) Statistical Reports on General Elections to State              Legislative Assemblies for election data. 24  These reports provide important information related to              elections, such as the name and code of the constituency, candidates and their vote shares, electorate              size (number of registered voters), number who turned out to vote (number of voters), the candidate’s              gender and constituency type (whether reserved for SCs (STs) or non-reserved).       25  For criminal              accusations, we rely on the data from sown aﬃdavits that have been collected and digitalized by              the Election Watch, in collaboration with the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR).        26  The              ADR data provide information on the number of criminal cases against each candidate, the charges              associated with each criminal case, a classiﬁcation of each accusation as serious or not, the asset and              liabilities disclosures of each candidate and each candidate’s level of education.                  We consider all state elections held between 2004 and 2008. While the light data are available              from 1992 onwards, we are limited by the data on aﬃdavits, which became mandatory only after the              Supreme Court order in 2003. Further, ADR data are available only for elections held after 2004.              As a result, we have a sample of 20 states out of a total of 28 covering approximately 90 percent of              India’s total electorate. 27  Also, the constituency boundaries changed in 2008 meaning constituencies              before and after delimitation are not comparable. 28  Thus, between the Court order to ﬁle aﬃdavits              in 2003 and the redrawing of boundaries in 2008, we observe only 1 election per state. However, we              utilize the night-lights data until 2012 for some states. 29  Table A-1 reports the information on the               24 The reports are available at http://eci.nic.in/eci_main1/ElectionStatistics.aspx, accessed in May 2014.               25 According to the Indian Constitution, certain seats are reserved for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes             (STs), the two historically disadvantaged minority groups. While registered voters from all social groups can vote,             only an SC (ST) candidate may contest election from the seats reserved for SC (ST).               26 The ADR data is available for public use at www.myneta.info.               27 The included states are Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jhark-             hand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Odisha, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh,             Uttarakhand and West Bengal. The states excluded from our analysis are Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jammu and             Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram, Rajasthan and Sikkim. Note that these states are excluded from             the analysis based on the pre-determined timing of their elections. Consequently, there is no reason to believe that             there are any systematic diﬀerences between included and excluded states (particularly with respect to the growth of             night lights or criminally accused candidates).               28                 The boundaries for constituencies were ﬁxed in 1976 until the Delimitation Act of 2002. This Act constituted a             Delimitation Commission to redraw the constituency boundaries based on the 2001 census ﬁgures. Based on the delay             in compiling the necessary data and in creating the new boundaries, the ﬁrst election with redrawn boundaries was             only held in Karnataka in 2008. Consequently, the period between 1976 and 2008 had ﬁxed constituencies boundaries             allowing for the comparison of satellite imagery across time. Once the new boundaries were implemented, it is not             possible to make a comparison between the two periods.               29                 The aﬃdavits are available starting with the ﬁrst election held after the Supreme Court order in 2003. For             example, the order was ﬁrst eﬀective in 2004 in Arunachal Pradesh and the ﬁrst election after the boundaries changed                                                                 14","number of assembly constituencies and information on year in which the elections were held in each              state after the Supreme Court order from the ADR website.                  Our main variable of interest is the criminal accusations. 30  A potential concern with accusations              is that political rivals may ﬁle false cases to gain electoral advantages. Unfortunately, it is not              possible to distinguish between “true” and “false” criminal accusations. Despite this limitation, these              data have been widely used to measure criminal accusations (Aidt et al. 2015, Asher and Novosad              2014, Banerjee et al. 2014, Fisman et al. 2014). There is some evidence to suggest that false cases              are not as frequent as might be believed. Looking at a sub-sample of states, Vaishnav (2011a) ﬁnds              that accusations are unrelated to prior electoral performance (a proxy for popularity), incumbency,              and the timing of elections. In addition, only cases ﬁled 6 months prior to elections need to be              reported, therefore it is less likely the criminal charges are electorally motivated.                  In our baseline speciﬁcation, we deﬁne a binary variable for whether or not a candidate is currently              accused in any criminal case. Speciﬁcally, this variable takes a value of 1 if MLA faces any current              criminal cases and 0 otherwise. Given the setup in a RD design, we only consider races in which,              among the top-2 candidates, one is accused and the other is non-accused. This is because the              RD design implicitly assumes that voters are faced with a choice between two types of candidates              (accused and non-accused). In practice, the top-2 (or even all the candidates) might be of the same              type. We therefore restrict the sample to constituencies in which the top-2 candidates represent              each type (accused and non-accused). This restricts our sample from the full 2633 constituencies for              which we have data to a smaller sample of 941 constituencies, which are observed annually during              our sample period over two successive elections in each state, totaling over 3600 observations. 31                  While we are not the ﬁrst study to use the data on criminal accusations, few studies, Vaishnav              (2011a) being a notable exception, consider the type of charges. This is particularly important              was held in 2009. So for Arunachal Pradesh, our (post-treatment) sample period is from 2004-2009. However, for             Uttar Pradesh the ﬁrst election after the order, took place in 2007 and the ﬁrst election after the changes in the             boundaries was held in 2012. As a result, our sample period for Uttar Pradesh is from 2007-2012.               30                 It is not possible to examine convictions since there are only a handful of cases in which criminal proceedings lead             to a conviction. Ideally, we would be able to use earlier accusations and examine whether candidates are subsequently             convicted. However, the data on accusations are only recent and the Indian judicial process frequently takes years or             even decades to resolve cases. According to Sukhtankar and Viashnav (2015), of the 76 MPs serving in the 15th Lok             Sabha (2009 national elections) who faced ongoing criminal action, the case had been pending for an average 7 years.               31                 Note that our results are robust to using the full sample. We choose this restricted sample since this is the implicit             comparison in a RD design. According to Lehne et al. (2016) the median number of candidates per state assembly             election is eight, however only the top-2 candidates are competitive: the third placed candidates average 7% of the             vote, the fourth placed candidates average 3%, the ﬁfth 1.6% and the rest less than 1%.                                                                  15","since not all charges are of the same severity or relevance in assessing a candidate’s aptness for              public oﬃce. We consider whether a speciﬁc charge associated with a criminal case is serious, and              whether it is related to any ﬁnancial wrongdoing. Since any deﬁnition of serious criminal charges is              inherently arbitrary, we rely on the classiﬁcation used by the ADR which is based on such factors as              the maximum punishment under the law, their violent nature, and oﬀenses under the Prevention of              Corruption Act.  32  Since ADR does not classify charges into ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial categories,              we deﬁne a charge as ﬁnancial if the corresponding IPC refers to a crime resulting in a loss to the              public exchequer. 33  Similar to the variable for any criminal case, we create binary variables for              whether or not a candidate is accused of a serious or ﬁnancial criminal charge.                  Our baseline deﬁnition of criminal accusations is whether a candidate has any criminal case              against him/her. We reﬁne our deﬁnition of criminally accused further by considering candidates              who face multiple criminal cases. Insofar as there is a cost to framing false cases against politicians,              we might expect that a higher number of cases might be a more reliable indicator of a politician’s              true type. Additionally, this also provides a measure of the“intensity of the treatment”. Accordingly,              we should expect the treatment eﬀects to become larger as the treatment intensity increases. We              consider two thresholds: a candidate is criminally accused if he/she has 2 or more cases or if he/she              has 5 or more cases.                  Table 1-C reports descriptive statistics of the data on criminal accusations. Approximately 53-              percent of the winners in our sample report at least one criminal case, while 40-percent are facing              at least one serious charge, and 19-percent at least one ﬁnancial charge. Although some of the              diﬀerences between the winners and the runners-up are statistically signiﬁcant in the full sample in              Table 1-B, these become insigniﬁcant when we look at the sample of close elections which is selected              by the optimal bandwidth criterion. Table 1-B also reports the predetermined constituency and                32 ADR compiles detailed data on each candidate’s criminal cases and the type of charges framed in each case. It             reports the exact criminal charge(s) for each candidate as deﬁned under the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The IPC is             the main criminal code of India that covers all substantive aspects of criminal law. ADR deﬁnes serious criminal             charges using eight criteria. They are: (1) Whether the maximum punishment for the oﬀense committed is of ﬁve             years or more, or; (2) Whether the oﬀense is non-bailable, or; (3) Oﬀenses pertaining to the electoral violation             (IPC 171E or bribery), or; (4) Oﬀense related to the loss to exchequer, or; (5) Oﬀenses the nature of which are             related to assault, murder, kidnap, rape, or; (6) Oﬀenses that are mentioned in Representation of the People Act,             or; (7) Oﬀenses under Prevention of Corruption Act, or; (8) Oﬀenses related to the Crimes against women. The             following is a link to an online Appendix on ADR criteria for coding serious crimes:http://adrindia.org/content/             criteria-categorization-serious-criminal-cases.               33                 This classiﬁcation is based on consultations with several high level Indian Police Service oﬃcers and we classify             the following IPCs as ﬁnancial crimes: 171B, 171E, 230–262, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276, 378–420, and 466–489D.                                                                  16","candidate characteristics for the previous year, thus only includes 1 data per included constituency.              Further, Figure A-7 depicts the distribution of criminally accused MLAs across Indian States.                 4.3    Validity of the RD Design                   There are two standard tests to show the validity of the RD design (Imbens and Lemieux 2008).              The ﬁrst is the McCrary (2008) density test for a discontinuity at the cutoﬀ in the density of the forc-              ing variable. In our context, this tests for whether criminally accused candidates disproportionately              win close elections. For instance, criminally accused politicians might be able to manipulate elec-              tions and therefore be more likely to win close elections, thereby violating the identifying assumption              that the treatment is randomly assigned. If this were the case, we would ﬁnd a larger frequency              of criminally accused candidates compared to non-accused candidates in the neighborhood of the              cutoﬀ. This would imply that the density of the margin of victory, the forcing variable, would show              a discontinuity at the cutoﬀ. Panels (a)-(b) of Figure 1 shows that the density of the victory margin              above and below the cutoﬀ is not statistically signiﬁcant.                  The second test of the validity of the RD design is whether the observed characteristics of              candidates and constituencies are continuous around the cutoﬀ. That is, while the characteristics              for criminally accused and non-accused candidates may be diﬀerent over the entire sample, with the              exception of the treatment, no other variable should be discontinuous around the cutoﬀ. For instance,              recent papers (Caughey and Sekhon 2011, Grimmer et al. 2011) have shown that in the context of              U.S. elections, the incumbent party tends to have systematically greater chances of winning even              when elections are close. However, Eggers et al. (2014) use data on 40,000 closely contested races              in diﬀerent electoral settings, including India, and do not ﬁnd any systematic evidence of sorting or              imbalance around the electoral thresholds.                  We formally check for continuity of various constituency characteristics in Figure 2 and candidate              characteristics in Figure 3. The variable on the y-axis is net of state and year ﬁxed eﬀects. The dots              in the scatter plot depict the averages over each successive 0.5% interval of the margin of victory.              The curves are local linear regressions ﬁt separately for positive and negative margins of victory using             a triangular kernel and the optimal bandwidth calculator suggested by Imbens and Kalayanaraman               (2012). The conﬁdence intervals are the 95% conﬁdence intervals plotted using standard errors that                                                                  17","are clustered at the constituency level.                  In Panels (a)–(g) of Figure 2, we compare accused winners to non-accused winners on growth              of night lights in the prior years (t-1 and t-2) and on several other constituency characteristics:              the electorate size, the number of voters, whether a constituency was aligned with the ruling party              in the state, in the previous election, and whether a constituency is reserved for Scheduled Caste              (SC) or Scheduled Tribes (ST). Similarly, in Panels (a)–(c) of Figure 3, we perform the continuity              checks for candidate characteristics: MLA’s incumbency status and gender, in the previous election.              These results indicate that there are no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the observed covariates              around the cutoﬀ. Therefore, the results from the McCrary test and the continuity of covariates              strongly suggest that the assumptions underlying the RD design are valid in this setting and that              the outcome of a close election is as good as random.                 5     Criminally Accused Politicians and Economic Activity                 5.1    Main Results                   We present the main results with a graphical illustration of the RD eﬀect of electing criminally              accused candidates in Figure 4 which plots the yearly growth of night-time lights against the margin              of victory for the criminally accused candidates.  34  The yearly growth of night-time lights is the              residual from the regression of yearly growth of night-time lights on state and year dummies. The              scatter plot shows the local averages of the residuals in each successive interval of 0.5 percent of              margin of victory. The solid curves are plotted non-parametrically using a local linear regression              with a triangular kernel and the optimal bandwidth criterion proposed by Imbens and Kalyanaraman              (2012). Positive margins of victory indicate a constituency in which a criminally accused candidate              won against a non-accused candidate (the runner-up), while a negative margin shows that she/he              was the runner-up and that the winner was not criminally accused. The RD ﬁgure shows a sharp              diﬀerence in the average yearly growth of night lights at the cutoﬀ (MARGIN = 0). The vertical              diﬀerence between the red and blue lines reﬂects the estimated causal eﬀect of electing a criminally              accused candidate on the yearly growth of night-time lights. In particular, at the cutoﬀ, there is a               34                 The sample consists of elections in which, among the top-2 candidates, one is accused and the other is non-accused             (see Section 4.2 for detailed discussion).                                                                 18","statistically signiﬁcant and negative eﬀect of electing a criminally accused candidate.                  Table 2 reports the size of the estimated RD eﬀects. In column (1) we use a local linear regression              with the optimal bandwidth (h) criterion proposed by Imbens and Kalyanaraman (IK). This is our              main speciﬁcation and is analogous to Figure 4. We ﬁnd a statistically signiﬁcant negative eﬀect of              electing criminally accused candidates: the annual growth of night-time lights is approximately 22              percentage points lower in constituencies that barely elect a criminally accused candidate as com-              pared to those constituencies that barely elected a candidate without accusations. 35  For robustness,              we also present these results using alternate bandwidths in columns (2)-(4). In column (2), we use              a bandwidth calculated using the Calonico, Cattaneo and Titiunik (CCT) (2014) algorithm, while              in columns (3)-(4) we halve and double the IK bandwidth, respectively. The results in column (2)              are quantitatively identical to those in column (1). Halving the bandwidth in column (3) results in              a slightly larger estimate, while doubling the bandwidth in column (4) leads to a smaller estimate.              Overall, the results remain statistically signiﬁcant and similar in magnitude.                  As discussed in sub-section 4.1, we use the intensity of night-time lights as a proxy for economic              activity (see Pinkovskiy and Sala-i-Martin 2016 for an overview on the link between night-time lights              data and GDP). It is, however, unclear what is driving the changes in night-time lights. For example,              the growth in night-time lights could represent changes in the supply of electricity. Alternately, it              could be attributable to changes in demand, or some combination of the two. Irrespective of whether              these changes are supply or demand-side driven, economic activity and the intensity of night-time              lights should be correlated (although certainly not one-to-one). While we currently interpret these              results in terms of night-time lights intensity, we compute the corresponding decline in GDP using              existing estimates of the elasticity of growth of night lights to the growth of GDP in Section 7.                5.2    Types and the Number of Charges                    In this subsection we begin by examining whether the costs of electing accused politicians vary              based on the underlying charges. If the economic costs associated with electing criminal politicians              are attributable to accused politicians, we would expect that both the type of charge and the number             of underlying cases would matter. As noted in sub-section 4.2, we deﬁne the types of charges, ﬁrst,                35 In Table A-2 we estimate Table 2 with year ﬁxed eﬀects (in Panel A) and with state-year ﬁxed eﬀects (in Panel             B) and ﬁnd the RD estimates to be identical.                                                                 19","by their seriousness, and second, by whether the charges are related to any loss to public exchequer              (ﬁnancial crimes).                  We report the results by the type of charges in Table 3. In columns (1)-(4) of Panel A, we              estimate the RD eﬀect of electing candidates accused of ﬁnancial charges on the yearly growth of              night-time lights. In particular, we compare constituencies with a winner who is accused of at least              1 ﬁnancial charge (and a loser who is not accused) to constituencies with a non-accused winner (and              a loser who has at least 1 ﬁnancial charge). Similarly, in columns (5)-(8), we examine the eﬀect              of electing candidates accused of only non-ﬁnancial crimes where we compare constituencies with              a winner who is accused of at least 1 crime but has no ﬁnancial charge (and the runner up is not              accused) to constituencies with a non-accused winner (and a runner up with at least 1 accusation              but no ﬁnancial accusation). We perform a similar analysis with serious charges in Panel B. We ﬁnd              consistent results: the type of charges matters. The coeﬃcients for both ﬁnancial and serious crimes              are consistently signiﬁcant and larger in magnitude (in absolute terms) than those estimated for any              charge in column (1) of Table 2. In contrast, non-ﬁnancial and non-serious charges are consistently              statistically insigniﬁcant.                  In Table 4, we examine the eﬀect of the number of criminal cases. A larger number of cases              can be viewed as a “higher intensity treatment” and, insofar as there are costs to manufacturing              and ﬁling false charges, may be more likely to represent “true” accusations. In columns (1)-(4) we              present the results of the impact of electing a candidate with two or more charges, while columns              (5)-(8) present the results for candidates accused of ﬁve or more charges. Similar to the results with              ﬁnancial and serious charges, the number of criminal cases has a clear negative eﬀect. The estimated              coeﬃcients are consistently negative and statistically signiﬁcant and greater than the eﬀect for any              charge [column (1) in Table 2].  36  Taken together, the results from Tables 3 and 4 demonstrate              that the characteristics of the candidate, speciﬁcally the candidate’s accusation record, underlie the              earlier results and that the costs increase with the severity of the charge.                36 We estimate similar models using the alternate thresholds of 2 and more ﬁnancial (serious) charges, and 5 or             more ﬁnancial (serious) charges. The results are qualitatively similar to those in Table 4. The table is available upon             request.                                                                         20","5.3    Timing of the Negative Eﬀects                   We next examine whether the eﬀect of electing accused politicians varies across the years of an              accused politician’s term. That is, is the negative eﬀect instantaneous (e.g. appear in the ﬁrst year              of the term) and then remains constant throughout the term or rather does it accumulate over time?                  In Table 5, we estimate the eﬀect of elected an accused candidate separately for each year of              the term. We also present the graphical illustration of the RD eﬀect in Figure 5. The results show              that the negative eﬀect does not appear instantaneously; there are no eﬀects in the years 1 or 2. In              contrast, the estimated coeﬃcients become statistically signiﬁcant in years 3 and 4, with both the              magnitude and signiﬁcance of the estimated coeﬃcient increasing over time.                  We interpret these ﬁndings to mean that the election of criminally accused politicians does not              instantaneously result in lower economic activity and that the economic costs show up after a lag.              For politicians to engage in corrupt behavior, they require collaboration with local bureaucrats (Iyer              and Mani 2012). Consequently, a certain amount of time is necessary for corrupt politicians and              bureaucrats to form a nexus and to engage in corrupt activity. For example, the eﬀect of neglected              public infrastructure, such as roads etc., may take some time to slow down economic activity.                 5.4    Heterogeneous Impact by State Characteristics                   We now examine whether the eﬀect of electing criminally accused politicians varies with state              characteristics. First, we consider the so-called“BIMAROU”states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Ut-              tar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand (The acronym BIMAROU is formed using the ﬁrst letters of the word              ‘sick’: in Hindi). These states are widely considered to be lagging behind in terms of economic devel-              opment and have been singled out for being corrupt and generally dysfunctional. Second, we consider              the set of states that the Ministry of Finance classiﬁes as being “Least Developed” and “Relatively              Developed”. 37  Finally, using measures of corruption created by Transparency International India’s             (TII), drawn from the India Corruption Study of 2005, we classify states into “High-Corruption” and               “Low-Corruption” states. 38               37                 The Ministry of Finance classiﬁes the following states as being “Least Developed”: Arunachal Pradesh, Assam,             Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh and “Relatively Developed”: Goa, Haryana, Kerala, Maharashtra,             Punjab, Tamil Nadu, and Uttarakhand.               38                 TII classiﬁes the following states as being “High Corruption”: Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Jharkhand, Assam, and             Bihar and “Low-Corruption”: Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Punjab, West Bengal, Odisha, and                                                                 21","We present the results in Table 6. The RD estimate for BIMAROU states are reported in Panel              (A), while Panel (B) reports the estimate for Least Developed states, and ﬁnally Panel (C) reports              the estimate for High-Corruption states. These eﬀects are negative and statistically signiﬁcant. The              size of the coeﬃcients for BIMAROU and Least Developed states are roughly one and a half times              larger than our main result [Table 2, column (1)] and slightly more than double for High-Corruption              states [The coeﬃcient is −21.74 for our baseline result (all states), −45.76 for BIMAROU states,              −49.46 for Least Developed states, and −51.29 for High-Corruption states]. However, the results              are statistically insigniﬁcant for Non-BIMAROU, Relatively Developed and Low Corruption states              as shown in Table A-3.                  Since there is substantial overlap between the states in the BIMAROU, Least Developed and              High Corruption classiﬁcations, it is diﬃcult to isolate one particular factor. Rather, we see that              the eﬀects of electing accused politicians are largely conﬁned to certain states. One common feature              of these states is the relatively weaker institutions whether judicial, police or political. Anecdotal              evidence suggests that in states with stronger institutions, the actions of criminal politicians are              more constrained. In contrast, those states with lower quality institutions have reputations of lawless              behavior and general impunity for politicians and bureaucrats. Thus, a criminally accused politician              may be more able to compromise governance where institutions are weaker or less developed.                 6     Criminally Accused Politicians and Public Good                    Our main results use night-time lights as a measure of economic activity. Using data from the              PMGSY program, we examine an alternate measure of economic development and a proxy for public              good provision: the length of roads built annually under PMGSY (in kms).                  We present the graphical illustration of the RD eﬀect (and the balance test) of electing criminally              accused candidates on the length of roads built annually in Figure 6 and the results from local linear              regression by state characteristics and the types of accusation in Tables 7, 8 and 9. We report the              results for all states in Panel A, BIMAROU states in Panel B, Least Developed states in Panel C,              and High Corruption states in Panel D. We ﬁnd that the length of roads constructed is lower in              constituencies represented by criminally accused candidates (Panel A in Figure 6 and Table 7) as              Uttar Pradesh.                                                                 22","compared to constituencies that elected non-accused candidates. Similar to the night-time lights              results (Table 6, Panel A and B), we ﬁnd the negative impact varies by ‘BIMAROU’ and ‘Least              Developed’ states, although the estimated coeﬃcient no longer varies by the types of accusation.              Overall, it is reassuring to ﬁnd similar results using a completely diﬀerent measure of economic              development.                  Surprisingly, we do not ﬁnd negative impact of electing criminally accused politicians on roads              construction for the high corruption states; this may be due to the smaller number of road projects              approved and constructed in some of the high corruption states.   39  In addition, these states are less              dependent than the BIMAROU or Least Developed states on federal transfer of funds. Lastly, we              cannot rule out the fact that the nature of corruption might diﬀer in high corruption states; for              example, criminal politicians could be corrupt in ways that are harder to detect and not necessarily              through the roads construction program.                  Road construction in India is widely believed to be plagued with rampant corruption and fre-              quently involves manipulation of the tenders and the process of procurement, often leading to lower              quality and unﬁnished road projects (WSJ 2012).    40 ,41  By matching contractors’ and political can-              didates’ last names in the PMGSY program, Lehne et al. (2016) ﬁnds a 63-percent increase in the              share of roads allocated to contractors who share their last name when the politician gets elected.              In addition, they show that the preferential allocation also increases the likelihood of missing roads              using the 2011 census data. They advance two reasons to explain why a road would be listed as              missing, both of which are indicative of corruption. Firstly, roads may be listed as completed with-              out ever being built. Secondly, roads could be built with sub-standard materials leading to their              complete or partial deterioration by the time of the 2011 census.                  These results complement our ﬁndings with the night-time lights and are consistent with the              view that accused politicians are detrimental to economic development and public good delivery.               39 States that have recorded the highest road construction are the BIMAROU and Least Developed states, for e.g.             Madhya Pradesh (63,548 km), followed by Rajasthan (58,462 km), Uttar Pradesh (45,905 km), Bihar (35,510 km)             and Odisha (35,019 km).               40 http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2012/05/04/road-building-still-tarred-with-corruption/.               41                 A senior oﬃcial reported that “road maﬁas” of contractors, engineers, the local police, civil servants, “and last but             not least local politicians”, conspire to keep prices on road contracts above market rates (Singh 2005).                                                                        23","7     Rough Calculation of the Eﬀect on GDP                    In this section, we calculate a rough estimate of the impact of criminally accused politicians in             terms of GDP loss. So far, due to the absence of local economic indicators, we use changes in the               intensity of night-time lights as a proxy for economic activity; however, it is possible to estimate             the impact in terms of GDP by using existing estimates of the elasticity of GDP with respect to               night-time lights. These elasticities have been calculated in settings where data exist for both the             intensity of night-time lights and local economic activity. In particular, we focus on Henderson et               al. (2012) estimate for a global sample of low and medium income countries, 0.3, and Bickenbach et             al.’s (2013) India-speciﬁc district-level estimate of elasticity of 0.107. Since there are no reliable and               systematic ﬁgures for growth at the constituency level, the latter represents the most disaggregated             estimate of the elasticity for India. These two elasticities allows us to calculate a rough upper and              lower-bound estimate of the eﬀect on growth rate of GDP.                  We present the “back of the envelop calculations” of GDP loss in Table 10. For the ease of              calculation, we report the RD estimates for the three types of accusations in Panel A (i.e. estimates              from column (1) of Table 2, and column (1) from Panel A and B of Table 3). In Panel B, we calculate              the impact of electing a criminally accused candidate on the growth rate of GDP in column (1), for              candidates accused of at least one ﬁnancial charge in column (2), and ﬁnally for candidates accused              of at least one serious charge in column (3). These estimates are calculated by multiplying the              coeﬃcients in Panel A with the relevant elasticities from the literature (i.e. the upper bound uses              the elasticity of 0.3, while the lower-bound uses the elasticity of 0.107). Depending on the type of              criminal accusation, we ﬁnd estimates ranging from 2.3-6.5 percentage point lower GDP growth per              year for our baseline estimates [column (1) in Panel A].                  Lastly, in Panel C, we calculate what would the GDP loss look like under these diﬀerent scenarios              based on the estimates from Panel B. Using a conservative estimate of 6-percent GDP growth as a              measure of average yearly constituency growth, this would imply that, on average, electing a crimi-              nally accused candidate would result in a 5.61 to 5.86-percent GDP growth per year (as compared              to the 6-percent otherwise). 42,43  These calculations are conservative since they are estimates of the                42 During this period, India experienced high growth rates ranging from 7.9 percent in 2003 to 9.8 percent in 2007.               43 These growth rates are based on the estimated eﬀects on Panel B. For instance, the upper bound estimate in             column (1) is -6.5 percent. Consequently, the constituency would only experience 93.5 percent of the normal growth                                                                  24","yearly cost, such losses are likely to compound over the full 5 year term.                  These rough estimates of the cost in terms of GDP growth raise parallel questions in terms of              the foregone poverty reduction and the eﬀects on distribution. While the data do not exist to verify              this, it is important to highlight that these are not just aggregate constituency-level costs; they are              likely commensurate micro-level costs.                 8     Robustness                    In this section, we perform further robustness checks using alternate functional forms, and alter-              nate deﬁnitions of the dependent variable. We also re-estimate our main result after controlling for              covariates in the RD regression (similar to Meyersson 2014), and ﬁnally examine the impact of top              coding on our results.                 8.1    Sensitivity Analysis of RD Speciﬁcation                   While earlier researchers emphasized the analysis of diﬀerent bandwidths (Imbens and Lemieux              2008), recent studies broaden the focus to include alternate control functions (Dell 2010, Lee and              Lemieux 2009, Meyersson 2014). We address this in Table A-4 which reports the RD eﬀects for linear,              quadratic, cubic, and quartic functions using the IK (h), CCT, h/2, and 2h bandwidth choices.       44              Variations in the polynomial order in the control function are ordered by row and bandwidth choices              by column in this table.                  By and large, we ﬁnd that the RD estimates are negative and statistically signiﬁcant and qualita-              tively similar to the eﬀect estimated in Table 2. Statistical signiﬁcance, however, is lost with larger              bandwidth and/or polynomial order of the control function.                8.2    Alternate Dependent Variables                    Since night-time lights and their distribution can be measured in several ways, we explore two al-              ternate deﬁnitions of the dependent variable: the intensity of night lights in levels [Log(Night Lights)]              which is 5.61 GDP growth per year.               44                 In results we do not present here, we also re-calculate the RD estimates using alternate bandwidth choices,             speciﬁcally 0.9h, 1.3h, 1.7h, 2.1h, where h(IK) = 6.35. We further repeat the same exercise for four additional             bandwidths (i.e. 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0) and ﬁnd similar results. Both tables are available upon request.                                                                 25","and the growth of night-time lights averaged over the election term of the candidate (Average Growth              over the Election Term). We present the estimates from RD eﬀect for the two dependent variables              in Table A-5. 45                  While we focus on the yearly growth of night-time lights (for better comparison across con-              stituencies), both growth rates and levels are used when researchers talk about growth. Moreover,              large percentage changes due to a small initial level can mask very small absolute changes. We              therefore estimate the local linear RD regression using the IK bandwidth for night-time lights in              levels and present the result in column (1). For our second measure, we consider the growth of night              lights averaged over the election term of the candidate to address the potential eﬀect of year to year              volatility. We present this estimate in column (3).                  Results from Table A-5, columns (1)-(2) suggest that the point estimates remain statistically              signiﬁcant and negative using the alternate deﬁnitions of the dependent variable.                 8.3    Controlling for Covariates                   In an RD framework, it is not necessary to control for various pre-determined covariates as the              treatment is independent of these covariates at the cutoﬀ. However, it is possible to directly control              for the covariates and estimate the local linear RD regression. We present the RD results in Table              A-6, where we do not control for baseline value of log night-lights in the year before election in Panel              A and with the baseline value of log night-lights as a control in Panel B.                  We present the RD regression result with only year ﬁxed eﬀects in column (1), with state and year              ﬁxed eﬀects in column (2) [similar to Table 2, column (1)], and ﬁnally in addition to state and year              ﬁxed eﬀects we add constituency characteristics (i.e. growth of night lights in t-1, growth of night              lights in t-2, electorate size, number of voters, whether a constituency was aligned with the ruling              party in the state, in the previous election, and whether a constituency is reserved for Scheduled              Caste (SC) or Scheduled Tribes (ST)) and candidate characteristics (for e.g. MLA’s incumbency              status and gender, in the previous election) in column (2) .                  Overall, our results remain similar to our main ﬁndings in Table 2. This provides further reas-             surance about the validity of the RD design in our context.                45 The graphical illustration of the RD eﬀect, and the validity of the balance test are available upon request.                                                                   26","8.4    Top Coding                   As previously noted, the night-time lights data are censored at 63. While this is not an issue in              less developed areas, this could be an issue in the wealthiest and most populated areas where we              cannot observe any changes above an intensity of 63. Although this is unlikely to be systematically              correlated with the accusation status of elected candidates, we directly address this in Table A-7. In              our RD sample, there are 63 fully lit constituencies. In Panel A, we drop any observations where the              constituency-year pixel average is 63. In Panel B, we drop any constituency in which the average              pixel intensity for any year is 63. In both cases, the results are both qualitatively and quantitatively              similar to our main results.                 9     Conclusions                    In this paper, we estimate the aggregate economic costs of electing criminally accused politicians              at the constituency level using data on the intensity of night-time lights and the sworn aﬃdavits of              candidates on their criminal background. We ﬁnd several important results. We ﬁnd a large negative              and causal impact as the yearly growth of the intensity of night lights is roughly 22-percentage point              lower for constituencies that barely elect a criminally accused candidate as compared with those that              do not. The estimated eﬀect is not just statistically signiﬁcant but it is also economically meaningful;              this eﬀect translates into roughly a 2.3-percentage point lower GDP growth per year [Column (1)              from Panel B of Table 10]. While we only have aggregate constituency level outcomes, this forgone              growth must also impact poverty reduction and other micro-level development outcomes.                  Using data on the speciﬁc charges elected representative (e.g. serious or ﬁnancial criminal charge              vs. any criminal charge) we ﬁnd large variation in the impact of electing accused politicians on the              intensity of night-time lights. In contrast, the election of candidates with only non-serious or non-              ﬁnancial charges has no impact on the subsequent growth. Additionally, this eﬀect increases with              the number of underlying criminal cases, which may serve as an indicator of ‘intensity of treatment’.              This variation not only highlights the importance of the precise accusations but also more reliably              captures the potential criminality of politicians. This possibility is further underlined by the gradual              accumulation of the costs over time.                                                                   27","We further examine how the impact of electing criminally accused candidates varies across state              characteristics. We ﬁnd that the costs are more pronounced in states with high corruption levels,              lower levels of development and those which plausibly have weaker institutions (‘BIMAROU’ states).              This suggests that the local context may mitigate the detrimental eﬀect of electing lower quality              politicians, such as accused politicians. While we cannot identify the precise channels, we believe that              institutions can play an important role in constraining the actions of elected politicians. Additionally,              in the spirit of Kremer’s ‘O-Ring’ theory (1993), local growth might depend on several complementary              pieces including eﬀective leadership. In certain contexts, such as less developed areas, there is no              redundancy in leadership making the eﬀects of inferior politicians more detrimental.                  Finally, using data on roads construction – a commonly used measure of public goods provision              in developing countries – we ﬁnd a large negative impact of criminally accused on the length of              roads built under PMGSY. This negative eﬀect varies by state characteristics and is largely driven              by ‘BIMAROU’ and ‘Least Developed’ states.                  We interpret our key dependent variable as a measure of economic activity, but it may also proxy              for access to electricity. Taken together, roads construction and access to electricity are arguably              some of the most important public goods in India, thus the negative impact we estimate is likely to              have important welfare consequences. Consequently, the election of accused politicians and, more              generally, of lower quality politicians may have adverse eﬀects along a variety of dimensions.                  More broadly, our results are consistent with the literature on patronage democracies. One              manifestation of a patronage democracy is the election of politicians who are able and willing to              provide targeted beneﬁts (Burgess et al. 2015). These beneﬁts could be targeted based on caste              as in India (Chandra 2004), class, or ethnicity in other contexts. Therefore, instead of focusing on              the overall outcomes (such as the delivery of public goods), voters focus on whether politicians can              deliver targeted transfers to their speciﬁc group or caste. Not only are voters perhaps more likely              to overlook accusations but these accusations might serve as a signal of the politician’s willingness              to use the oﬃce to reward fellow-group members (Chauchard 2014, Wade 1985). If true, our results              suggest three consequences. First, this can result in the election of criminally accused candidates,              and therefore potentially explain the ever increasing number of accused politicians who are elected              in India. Second, the election of lower quality candidates in patronage democracies leads to lower                                                                   28","aggregate growth. Third, these eﬀects, however, are mediated by the local context (especially the              institutional and legal context). In the more developed, and less corrupt states in our sample, the              eﬀects of the accused politicians were lower, perhaps due to the strength of institutions.                  Although we study a particular context, lower quality politicians are believed to be pervasive              in many developing countries. While the underlying cause is often context-speciﬁc and may range              from caste-politics to tribal and ethnic voting, we believe that our analysis is suggestive for other              contexts.                                                                                                                                     29","References               Abrahams, Alexei. 2015. “Hard Traveling: Redistributive Eﬀects of Commuting Costs in the Second                    Palestinian Uprising.” Working Paper.
